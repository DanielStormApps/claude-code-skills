Don't edit any code within the project. We are just going to talk about a task and look at code for now. Use ultrathink mode. Double check all your work along the way. Plan tasks as you see fit. You can create temporary files if needed but they must be cleaned up before replying here. Do not edit any code at this time. Your output should just be replies here please.

Review the plan md in the plans directory against the codebase and doublecheck everything to ensure it is correct and truthful. assume nothing, go and look at the code. we may have done some of the work already. mark that work as complete in the plan if you are able to confirm it as done 100%. Reply here with your findings when you are done.
